<h1>New character â€” Yes</h1>

<p>After our last session (actually not, since I didn't play during our last session), my original character, Placeholder, saw the abyss. She forgot everything true to herself, and fell into deep misery. She had killed someone innocent, something she had never done before, due to pure anxiety. Now, she is meditating on what to do next.</p>

<p>Most likely, due to her deep lack of intelligence, she won't be able to return to sanity after this. She will see no other option than to keep killing everything in her way in order to survive, seeking her own roots to understand who she really is. Maybe speaking to her ancestor, Felgolos, will help her seek the path she needs to find.</p>

<p>Now, a divine bell has been rung in the high mounts of the heavens. There's a terrible future laying ahead, they say. Plzhldr's "accident" was more than just an accident. It was the start of a new, dark era.</p>

<p>Yes, the youngest, but brightest child of Affirmation, was sent down to the material plane to help our heroes out. After having trained with martial arts with their brother, Aye, they now believe they are ready to survive in the chaotic forgotten realm.</p>

<p>There appears to be a problem, though: They have no clue where Plzhldr is, nor do they know how to guide her. No one taught the art of psychology at the Academia of his city, but with dedicated effort and reading they shall find what they need.</p>

<p>Or so the tale says...</p>
